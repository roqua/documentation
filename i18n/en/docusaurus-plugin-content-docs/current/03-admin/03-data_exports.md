The links under the header "File" provide access to the most recently generated data export. This export is created at night and therefore contains all the questionnaires that were completed before last midnight. You can find the codebooks in the downloaded file under the subfolder "codebooks".

<ul class="hints">
  <li>Different formats are maintained of the data export. If you remember the name and key of the format you downloaded, you can later download new data in the same format. Formats are supported for one year. After that, no more data export will be generated for it.</li>
  <li>All export formats contain the most recent data. Only the format of columns in an export file differs between the export formats.</li>
  <li>To see the difference between an older export format and the most recent format, click on the "View Differences" link. This can help with the transition from an old (no longer supported) format to the most recent export format.</li>
