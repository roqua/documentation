title: Dossier number change
sort: 100

Occasionally, an existing client dossier receives a new client number within the EPR, or a client accidentally was assigned two client numbers, and the data from both have to be merged.

In the RoQua Admin environment these two actions are classified under "Dossier number change". The Admin environment also contains an overview of all historical actions.

## Performing renumbering dossiers

<ul>
   <li><strong>Dossier number to expire</strong> is the old number that is no longer in use.</li>
   <li><strong>New dossier number</strong> is the client number to which all data must be transferred.</li>
   <li>If the new dossier number is already in use, confirmation of the merge is requested first. This yellow block appears after the first click on "Create dossier number change", but only if the new number is already known. </li>
</ul>
