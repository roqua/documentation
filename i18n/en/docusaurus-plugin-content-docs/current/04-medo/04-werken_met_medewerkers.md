# Administering users

## Users

Coordinators can administer users for their projects. By clicking on the **Users** menu item for a project, a table of users will be shown. Clicking a row shows you a form to edit the clicked user. Coordinators can also revoke user access to a project.

Clicking **Invite User** shows a form for supplying the email address and the desired role of the user you want to invite to the current project. If the user already has a Medoq account, they will immediately be able to access the project. If this is the first time the user is invited to a project, they will be sent an email for creating a Medoq account. Once their account is made they will be able to access the project.

You are only allowed to invite users with an email address on a domain that matches the configured **allowed domain names** of the project. The list of allowed domain names are configured by the RoQua team.
