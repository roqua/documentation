# Preparing questionnaires

At the top of every screen in RoQua is the "New Measurement" button.

At the bottom is the list of all protocols configured within your organization. Within a protocol there can be two things:

* Manual measurements: this is where you manually select and prepare questionnaires once. When preparing, you can choose an invitation to send, and optionally a reminder.
* Automatic protocols: TODO

## Favorites

You probably work most with a small set of protocols. For those protocols you can then click the Star button to mark them as favorites. Protocols that you give a star will appear at the top of your list, and will also be immediately expanded.

## Search and filter

To quickly find the right protocol you can filter the list in different ways:

### Department

With this filter you can limit the protocols to a specific department. This setting is saved to your user profile and is also used on other pages within RoQua.

### Measurement type

Here you can filter by type of measurement:
- **All**: shows all available protocols
- **Auto-protocols**: only protocols that automatically prepare questionnaires
- **Manual measurements**: protocols where you manually select and prepare questionnaires
- **Expert modules**: special modules such as PETRA

### Respondents

Filter by the type of respondent for whom the questionnaires are intended, for example patient, parent, partner or teacher.

### Free text search

You can also search by text. The system then searches the following fields:
- Protocol name
- Measurement name
- Questionnaire name

When you search for text, two things happen:
- All protocols automatically expand, so you can immediately see what's in them
- If a questionnaire name matches your search query, we show a list of the questionnaires that were found. This way you know exactly why a certain protocol appears in the results.
