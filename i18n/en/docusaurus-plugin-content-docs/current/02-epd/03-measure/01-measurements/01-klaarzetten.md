  <li>When preparing, you can also indicate from when the questionnaires should be ready. The selected lists can then only be completed from the chosen date.</li>
  <li>If no email is known in our system for the respondent, you will not see the option to send an invitation.</li>
  <li>The reminder is only sent if the list has not yet been completed.</li>
  <li>The invitation that is selected by default is a setting of the protocol and can be adjusted by the RoQua coordinator of your organization.</li>
