<Screenshot src="/screenshots/epd/measure-direct-invullen.png" />

Sometimes it is desirable to be able to complete a questionnaire directly on behalf of a respondent. This can be done by selecting a questionnaire and clicking the Fill out directly button. A screen now appears in which you can choose the desired situation.

1. **Interview** - You are now administering a questionnaire together with the patient.
2. **Transfer from paper** - You are entering a questionnaire that has already been completed on paper. When you choose this option, the option to set the date on which the paper list was administered also appears.

Click "Fill out" to start filling out the questionnaire. This is done without preparing and without login codes.
