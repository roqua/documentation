# Non-response

Sometimes prepared questionnaires are not completed by a patient or he or she is not approached for a ROM measurement. The reasons for this non-response can be registered in RoQua. They will then end up in the data export.

Select the reason for non-response and click "Create non-response". When the non-response concerns a measurement from the past, the date of non-response can be specified under the heading "Measurement Date".
