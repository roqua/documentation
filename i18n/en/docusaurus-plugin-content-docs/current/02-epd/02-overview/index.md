# Overview

This is normally the page you arrive at when you open RoQua. On this page you can see what still needs to be completed, what has been prepared, and what has recently happened for this client.

<!-- This interface contains a chronological overview of completed questionnaires, created invitations and reports. For each completed questionnaire it indicates when and by whom it was completed, under which measurement and protocol the list falls and whether there are any risks or points of attention. For an invitation it indicates when it was created and at what time it was (last) sent by email. Click on any item in the timeline for more information and options. -->

## Pending questionnaires

At the top of the overview page, each respondent is shown which questionnaires are ready to be completed and what the corresponding login code is.

## Available on own initiative

If configured, you can see here which questionnaires the client can complete on their own initiative. These questionnaires do not need to be prepared by a healthcare provider, but can be started by the respondent themselves when they want.
