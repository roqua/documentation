title: Responses
status: draft

Responses are questionnaire completions, although they need not be filled out yet. Upon creating an invitation, responses for all selected questionnaires are created. At this point, the responses have status `new`. When the patient fills out the questionnaire for the answer, its status will change to `completed`.

## List all responses for dossier

Requests for more detailed information about responses are namespaced under a specific [dossier](../dossiers/), which is the `/api/v1/dossiers/DOSSIER_ID` path. In this path `DOSSIER_ID` is the external identifier used by the EPD to represent this patient.

    GET /api/v1/dossiers/:dossier_id/responses.json

## Store a new response

To store an externally captured response perform a POST request to the path beneath. The `dossier_id` in the path is the unique identifier of the dossier to store the response with.

    POST /api/v1/dossiers/:dossier_id/responses/

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description
---- |------|--------------
`questionnaire_key` | `string`  | \[Required\] Key uniquely identifying the questionnaire in the ROM application
`external_id`       | `string`  | \[Required\] ID as managed by the external application that "owns" this response
`answer_data`       | `hash`    | \[Required\] Hash storing the answered option key for every question key
`started_at`        | `integer` | The Unix time when the questionnaire was started being filled out (greater or equal to 31 december 1999)
`filled_out_at`     | `integer` | The Unix time when the questionnaire was filled out (greater or equal to 31 december 1999)
`respondent`        | `string`  | \['patient'(default) \| 'parent' \| 'second_parent' \| 'teacher' \| 'caregiver' \| 'profess'\] String identifying the respondent which filled out the questionnaire
`entered_by`        | `string` | \[Optional, blank means response was entered by the respondent themselves.\] The user id of the professional that entered the response into the system. For responses that were not entered directly by the respondent. The user id should correspond to the user id of that professional that is used in the [EPD SSO](../../../rom/sso/epd_v3/) connection. In the case of a 'profess' respondent, the implication is that this professional was the evaluator/originator of the response data, but this is not a strict requirement.

## Update a response

To store external data on an existent pending response perform a put request to the path beneath.
