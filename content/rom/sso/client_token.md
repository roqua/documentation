title: Respondents using token
status: stable
---

The login for a patient (or other respondents for a dossier) is done by entering a token which the person has received by e-mail or snailmail. It's also possible to open the login URL with this token prefilled as a query parameter, in which case the login will happen automatically and the person will be presented the first pending questionnaire immediately.

## SSO URL

To open RoQua client-interface and start filling in pending questionnaires, tell a browser
window or frame to navigate to:

    https://:ggzname.roqua.nl/login


## Parameters

To this URL, you may add a number of query parameters. These parameters are used for specifying the token to be logged in, and specifying additional behaviour.

Name | Type | Description
---- |------|--------------
`token`              | `string`  | **Required**. The login token.
`return_url`         | `string`  | If given, when all pending questionnaires have been answered, thus completing the fill out session, RoQua will redirect to this URL instead of showing a default thank-you screen.
`progress_url`       | `string`  | URL of your [progress page][].
`stylesheet`         | `string`  | When given, this CSS URL will be loaded after our built-in stylesheets to allow some customization of the look and feel.

[progress page]: /developer/rom/dossier/fill_out_sessions/#progress-page
