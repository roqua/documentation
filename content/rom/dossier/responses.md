Responses are questionnaire completions, although they need not be filled out yet. Upon creating an invitation, responses for all selected questionnaires are created. At this point, the responses have status `new`. When the patient fills out the questionnaire for the answer, its status will change to `completed`.

## List open responses for given token

If you know the token that can be used to log in as a respondent, you can use that to request a list of the names of the questionnaires that will be presented when logging in with that token. This can be done without any authentication.

    GET /login.json?token=:token

### Response

<%= headers 200 %>
<%= json "questionnaires" => [
  {
    "key"               => "srs",
    "name"              => "SRS",
    "short_description" => nil
  },
  {
    "key"               => "oq45",
    "name"              => "OQ-45",
    "short_description" => "Outcome Questionnaire"
  },
  {
    "key"               => "scl90",
    "name"              => "SCL-90",
    "short_description" => "Klachtenlijst"
  }
]
%>

## List all responses for dossier

Requests for more detailed information about responses are namespaced under a specific [dossier](/developer/rom/dossier/dossiers/), which is the `/api/v1/dossiers/DOSSIER_ID` path. In this path `DOSSIER_ID` is the external identifier used by the EPD to represent this patient.

    GET /api/v1/dossiers/:dossier_id/responses.json
