On this page the user accounts in RoQua are managed. These accounts are automatically created when a professional accesses a dossier in RoQua through the EPR or Medoq for the first time. Click on the "Edit" button to edit a user's details. The search bar can be used to open the edit page of a specific user account name.

<ul class="hints">
  <li>You can change the details of your own account via the "Account" link under the drop-down menu at the top right of the interface.</li>
  <li>If you cannot find an account for a specific user, ask this employee to open RoQua once from the EPR. A RoQua account will be created automatically.</li>
</ul>

You can now update your personal details, set a new password or manage the rights of an account. The "Practitioner" role is a role that is assigned to every employee as standard. By selecting the "Coordinator" role, you give a user access to coordinator functionality in the RoQua EPR interface (see the "Coordinator Functionality" subsection below). If you choose the "Manager" role, you give a user access to the RoQua admin interface. You can determine which tabs a user gets to see by checking them under "Rights".

The upper right 'Grant user rights + all other rights' is a special right that can only be distributed by RoQua support. However, the revocation (unchecking) of this right can be done by any user who may grant user rights. This makes it possible to deprive (for example departing) employees this right. This right gives a user in addition to all other existing rights also all rights that may be added to RoQua in the future.

## Coordinator functionality in the RoQua EPR Interface

Employees who have been granted the "Coordinator" role via the RoQua admin interface get access to additional functionality in the RoQua EPR interface. For example, these employees can delete completed questionnaires by clicking on the red icon with the trash can in the top right of the screen. They can also update questionnaires previously completed by the patient by clicking on the "Customize Answers" button. This can be useful when a patient indicates to have answered the questionnaire incorrectly.
