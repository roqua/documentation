## api

Authentication for /api is done by HTTP Basic authentication over SSL.

On /admin/api_tokens/new you can create an api_token. consumer_key is the username and consumer_secret the password.

When creating a right you can specify which endpoints it gives access to and allows you to specify the ip's that can access the api with that token.
