title: Overview

RoQua consists of several applications. Some of these are internal only,
but for the sake of simplicity, we keep documentation for everything in here, public and private applications alike. If a private application sounds like just the thing you need, feel free to contact us and we can see if we can make it a public webservice.

  * Core is our internal service that hands out internal dossier identifiers,
    and knows the personally identifying information about dossiers. This ensures
    that other applications and services only need to remember anonymous data.

  * ROM is the original RoQua application. It's used by health care providers
    and their patients. If you're unsure which documentation you need, you
    probably want to look at the API reference for RoQua ROM.
